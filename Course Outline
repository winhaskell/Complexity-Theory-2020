depending on the interest of the students, we may study other computational processes that 
arise in diverse areas of computer science, each with their own relevant efficiency measures. 

Specific possible topics include:

proof complexity, interactive proofs, and probabilistically checkable proofs -- motivated by verification,
pseudorandomness and zero-knowledge -- motivated by cryptography and security,
computational learning theory -- motivated by artificial intelligence,
communication complexity -- motivated by distributed computing,
query complexity -- motivated by databases.
